# Best Resume Match
Best for resume, document matching.
I used NLTK for keyword extraction and then RAKE for keywords/keyphrase scoring, then I applied cosine similarity.

Scikit for keywords extraction, tf-idf and cosine similarity calculation.

Gensim library with LSA/LSI model to extract keywords and calculate cosine similarity between documents and query.
